						<h3>In March 2025, Andrew and Chloe said <em>yes</em> to a future together at the same place where they had their first date!</h3>
						<p>We are so excited for the many years ahead. But first, how we met.</p>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>Finding each Other</h3>
								<p>We met in April 2021 when we were both living in Charleston, SC; Chloe moved there for her first job out of college and Andrew was stationed there while in the Navy. Since it was difficult to be out and about in a mid-to-post-covid era, we matched on Hinge and introduced ourselves briefly. We found that we wanted similar things; a natural meeting, a deep connection, and a real honest effort.

								<p>Andrew offered to meet Chloe on a "Choose Your Own Adventure" date, where we could "bump into each other" and experience the real emotions of a true first impression. Chloe told him that she'd be grocery shopping early the next morning, and that perhaps she'd "bump" into him in the ice cream aisle, where he could quote <em>"Help me carry gallons of ice cream to the checkout counter."</em> because she is an ice cream fanatic (and by fanatic she means she melts her ice cream, and THEN eats it).</p>

								<p>Unsure of if he'd actually show up, Chloe finished a night shift at her job and headed over to do her weekly grocery shopping. She was nervous and had butterflies, hoping he would be there. He had put on jeans and a leather jacket to try to look less like a computer nerd, and walked aisle to aisle wondering if people noticed that he wasn't buying anything. We eventually found each other in the greeting card aisle, were Chloe saw him turn the corner. We were both wearing masks, but we were both smiling undeneath and hearts definitely started racing. We walked up and down the aisles talking and getting to know each other's fun facts.</p>

								<p>After the shopping trip, Andrew said he'd like to take Chloe to Magnolia Gardens for a romantic and historic place nearby that was featured in movies, like "The Notebook". It was pollen season, so Chloe took her allergy medicine, knowing we'd be there for quite some time.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>First Date</h3>
								<p>We spent the whole day walking around the gardens getting to know each other -- even taking the longer trails so we could get more time with one another. We then grabbed some lunch at a southern BBQ restaurant and finished the day with some board games, namely Bananagrams.</p>

								<p>Knowing she'd have to work the night shift again, the date only ended because Chloe said she needed to get some sleep. We wanted to keep talking and to spend more time together. As we said goodbye, Andrew thanked Chloe for the fun date and, in a Gentleman's fashion, began to leave. Chloe, also feeling the date went well, offered Andrew a hug to end the date. Andrew holds firm that this was the moment he knew Chloe was his "one."</p>
							</div>

							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>Another Memorable Moment</h3>
								<p>On our second date, Chloe mentioned she was planning to quarantine for a few weeks for her belated college graduation ceremony. Andrew was so understanding and said he'd still be there after she got back to continue where we left off. He said something to Chloe that she'll never forget -- "My mom always taught me that when you find something or someone special, you hold onto it." That was the moment she knew he was her "one."</p>
							</div>

							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>The Next Chapter</h3>
								<p>In summer of 2022, we moved to Raleigh, NC. Chloe was hired as a digital reporter for CBS-17, and Andrew enrolled in graduate school at NC State after getting out of the Navy and following her up to the area.</p>

								<p>When Andrew graduated with his Master's degree in December 2023, we decided to move, on a job opportunity, to Lancaster, PA. We rented an old farm house, and made it our first home together in early 2024.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>Did she say Yes??</h3>
								<p>Andrew set up a trip for us to go back to Charleston in March of 2025 to visit with his sister Allison and her husband David, who had recently moved to the area. We wanted to revisit our old stomping grounds and also to celebrate their successes. Turns out they had been helping all along to build a surpise for Chloe. </p>

								<p>Andrew took Chloe back to Magnolia Gardens, where we had our first date, to ask for her hand in marriage. He got down on one knee in front of Magnolia's famous historic bridge, where he had set up photographers and video to capture the moment. Chloe cried (of course) and said yes to Andrew's teary-eyed proposal. We spent the rest of the morning taking engagement photos and celebrating with champagne on a special reserved balcony at the estate house.</p>

								<h3>We love sharing our story about how we met; from ice-cream to long walks, from hugs to toasts.</h3><p>We hope you also enjoyed our love story as much as we did and we can't wait to write the next chapter with you all along with us!</p>
